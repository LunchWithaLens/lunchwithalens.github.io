# Create an Azure Data Science VM for the fastai course

TL;DR - sign into the Azure portal, create a new resource, choose the Data Science Virtual Machine 18.04 - set a resource group, name the VM then choose a spot VM and look through the regions for the best price.  Set your ssh, skip through the other pages and click create on the review page - wait 3 minutes! Then add the [fastai stuff](https://github.com/fastai/fastai2)

## First steps

If anyone was thinking of using Azure VMs for this fastai course then hopefully this post will help!  Please be aware that VMs with GPU are not available for some of the ‘free’ Azure offers.  There may also be restrictions on the availability for certain regions too.  I cover the three pricing options that you might find for the low end GPU base VMs – the NC6 – and suggest the Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu) as a great starting point,
- Full price – most flexibility but highest price
- Promo price – special offers, usually on older hardware – same VM as the full price one
- Spot price – lowest price, but not guaranteed availability – your VM can be taken away at a moment’s notice.  Not great for long running processes, but usually ok for short runs.  Data is persisted even if the VM is taken away – but obviously anything in memory in a current run is lost.  Subscription credit options – like a Visual Studio account cannot usually be used for Spot prices.

## Getting Started with your VM

1.	Go to https://portal.azure.com and log in to (or sign up for) your Azure account.

2.	To create a Data Science VM click Create a resource and search for data science – and choose the Data Science Virtual Machine- Ubuntu 18.04 (The one that doesn’t say 18.04 is 16.04 but does have a few kore items added such as SQL Server)

3.	Click Create rather than the pre-set options
4.	The next screen gives the various details needed to configure the VM – and choices such as location, spot instance or not – and the authentication options.  I’ll step though the important options one at a time.

5.	If you have more than one Azure subscription you can choose from the drop down.
6.	The 2nd option is choosing or creating a resource group.  Think of this as a way to group all the resources you may be using – VM, additional disks, virtual networks…  It is convenient to have a group when you want to delete everything at the end – you can just delete the resource group.  I’m going to use rg-brismithfastai
7.	The virtual machine name needs to be unique – and will also be used as the host name for the server.  Mine will be called vmbrismithfastai.
8.	For the region there is an advantage obviously in choosing a region near you – for lower latency – but you may need to look at other regions to get the class of server you need.  I’ll start with West US.  [Click here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines) to get an idea which regions have the NC series VMs.
9.	To keep the price down I’ll not choose any availability options – but for production use these options give redundancy either within or across regions as well as scaling options.
10.	The image is pre-populated as the DSVM.
11.	I’ll be choosing a spot instance – but I’ll first show the other priced alternatives.  The default shown is non-GPU – DS3 v2 - $213.89/month in the region I’m looking at.  Leaving the spot instance as No and clicking Change size allow a view across all options. Adding NC into the search box limits my result set to the NC range I’m interested in.

12.	It will vary by region – but here I can see the low end NC6 which will be fine for the coursework has two options – full price estimate is $657 a month but there is also a ‘Promo’ version at under $300.  If I didn’t want the go for the spot price the promo one would be my next choice (and the idea is not to leave it running 24/7 – so the real price should be well under the $300 anyway).  But I’m going to take a look at spot option next.

13.	The options for spot allow either the lowest cost option – capacity only – or you can name your (higher) price to improve your chances of not being evicted!  I’ll stick with the first option.  As you can see there is only a Stop/Deallocate option – which means your VM will persist data when you are evicted.  The delete option is fine for compute only nodes – but doesn’t make sense when we need to keep our data.  Click Change size again and we see our spot pricing – and for our NC6 it is under $0.12 an hour! Almost tempted to step up to the NC12, but for now I’ll click NC6 and Select at the foot of the page.

The next option is the administrator account and the authentication type.  SSH is the preferred option here, and there is a,so a link on the page to help if you are not familiar with SSH.  If you are just doing the course work you may be comfortable with using a username/password instead. At this point my VM configuration looks like this – next we go to Disks.
