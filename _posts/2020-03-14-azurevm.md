# Create an Azure Data Science VM for the fastai course

TL;DR - sign into the Azure portal, create a new resource, choose the Data Science Virtual Machine 18.04 - set a resource group, name the VM then choose a spot VM and look through the regions for the best price.  Set your ssh, skip through the other pages and click create on the review page - wait 3 minutes! Then add the [fastai stuff](https://github.com/fastai/fastai2)

## First steps

If anyone was thinking of using Azure VMs for this fastai course then hopefully this post will help!  Please be aware that VMs with GPU are not available for some of the ‘free’ Azure offers.  There may also be restrictions on the availability for certain regions too.  I cover the three pricing options that you might find for the low end GPU base VMs – the NC6 – and suggest the Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu) as a great starting point,
- Full price – most flexibility but highest price
- Promo price – special offers, usually on older hardware – same VM as the full price one
- Spot price – lowest price, but not guaranteed availability – your VM can be taken away at a moment’s notice.  Not great for long running processes, but usually ok for short runs.  Data is persisted even if the VM is taken away – but obviously anything in memory in a current run is lost.  Subscription credit options – like a Visual Studio account cannot usually be used for Spot prices.

## Getting Started with your VM

1.	Go to https://portal.azure.com and log in to (or sign up for) your Azure account.

2.	To create a Data Science VM click Create a resource and search for data science – and choose the Data Science Virtual Machine- Ubuntu 18.04 (The one that doesn’t say 18.04 is 16.04 but does have a few kore items added such as SQL Server)
