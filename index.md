Hello and welcome to my new blog. I still have my own blog over at blogs.lunchwithalens.com, but on this new blog I plan to post about my Data Science journey - with a recap of what I've done so far, but also a I'll post on the experience going through the fast.ai v4 the 2020 running of the Part 1 course.

This blog is powered by the fast_template - see https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/20/blog_overview/ to get blogging for free!
